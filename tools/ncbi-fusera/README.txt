This directory contains scripts, which could be useful for setting up
FUSERA tree ... for developing/usage, for example :

sra-tools/tools/ncbi-fusera/install.sh dir_to_install

After run, that script will create following files and directories :

dir_to_install/bin
dir_to_install/pkg
dir_to_install/src/github.com/ - that directory contains sources of 
                                 'twig' and 'fusera' packages.

dir_to_install/ENV.txt         - that file contains very important
                                 definition
dir_to_install/README.txt      - that file is better to read before 
                                 start working

Please let me know if something wrong or work not like expected.

Thanks,
t.
