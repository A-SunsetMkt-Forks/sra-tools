NCBI External Developer Release: SRA Toolkit 2.6.3
May 25, 2016

  bam-load: Corrects an optimization used to compare read lengths when lengths are greater than 255
  bam-load: alignments which are below the minimum match count but with at least 1/2 of the aligned bases matching are accepted
  bam-load: improved performance of SAM parsing code
  bam-load: non-fatal result codes no longer cause the reader thread to quit early
  bam-load: will NOT do spot assembly using hard clipped secondary alignments even when make-spots-with-secondary is enabled;
            WILL do spot assembly using hard-clipped secondary alignments when defer-secondary is enabled
  build: MSVS 2013 toolset (12.0) is now supported across all repositories
  vdb: Fixed a bound on memory cache that would never flush under certain access modes


NCBI External Developer Release: SRA Toolkit 2.6.2
April 20, 2016

  align-cache: a tool producing vdbcache that reduces effects of random access and improves speed.
  bam-load: Fixed bug in validation code for unsorted bam files
  bam-load: If two (or more) local reference names refer to the same global reference,
    bam-load will record the first one used and report the change.
  bam-load: Secondary alignment will be used for spot assembly if the loader is explicitly told to use them
  bam-load: The code that had invalid item in index problem was removed in the process of addressing a performance issue.
  bam-load: change reporting of fatal warnings into fatal errors
  bam-load: changed from an error to a warning if using secondary alignments to create spots
  bam-load: low-match secondary alignments are now discarded; low-match primary alignments are logged,
    and if too many, it will abort the load.
  bam-load: records the contents of the BX tag
  bam-load: rules for spot assembly were reverted to assembling spots only on primary alignments
  blast, build: Improved blast tools: all required libraries are linked statically. 
  build: Allow to build sra-tools on systems without static c++ library
  check-corrupt, vdb-validate: Added a new set of checks that can be triggered by using one of two "--sdc:" cmd options
  copycat: now runs on Centos 7; no longer uses system-installed magic file
  dbgap-mount: Added support for standard options  "-L" and "-o", which allow users
    to determine the logging level and log output file
  dbgap-mount: New optional parameter was introduced '-u' which allows user
    to unmount FUSE/DOKAN volume. Implemented on linux and windows
  fastq-load: The (old) fastq-loader will properly report multiple reads on the 454 platform (and still fail).
  kar: added '--md5' option to create md5sum compatible auxiliary file
  kdb: Fixed VTableDropColumn, so that it can drop static columns
  kfs, kns, ngs, sra-tools: Fixed thread safety issues for both cache and http files
  kget: kget has a new option --full to match wget in speed. added examples.sh
  kproc: Fixed KQueue to wake waiters when sealed, fixed KSemaphore to wake waiters when canceled
  latf-load: now allows undescores inside spot group names 
  latf-load: now loads data produced by fastq-dump
  latf-load: updated to support Illumina tag line format with identifier at the front
  pileup-stats: added -V (--version) option: prints out the software
  pileup-stats: pileup-stats: added version support (options -V or --version)
  prefetch: Added --eliminate-quals option which speeds up HTTP download by ignoring QUALITY column`s data
  prefetch: Fixed failure when running prefetch.exe "-a<bin|key>" when there is a space after "-a"
  prefetch: messages about maximum size of download are made more user-friendly.
  prefetch: now will download even when caching is disabled
  ref-variation: --input-file option allows to specify input accessions and paths in the file
  ref-variation: added "count-strand" option: it controls relative orientation of 3' and 5' fragments.
  ref-variation: added -c option to flush output immediately; reporting zero matches
  ref-variation: added a way to specify a number of repeats of the query
  ref-variation: improved threading management
  ref-variation: removed irrelevant warnings reported in some cases in debug version only
  sam-dump: Segfault no longer occurs when confronted with large amounts of header lines
  sam-dump: added option to produce MD tags
  sam-dump: filters out duplicates in the rows that it generates
  sam-dump: produces BX-tags if preserved in SRA file by bam-load
  sra-sort: correctly generates spot-id column even in the absence of primary alignments
  sra-stat: no longer fails when CS_NATIVE column is not present.
  sra-tools, vdb-config: Removed dependency of mac binaries on unnecessary libraries, e.g. libxml2.
  sra-tools: https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/issues/27 : contains short and long examples of how to configure sra-tools build
  var-expand: a tool for batch variation expansion
  vdb-config: now handles standard options such as --option-file
  vdb-validate: Added code to continue with the next row when column has discontiguous blobs
